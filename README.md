OpenDoors Server
=================

OpenDoors is a small project I cooked up to open my pre-war NYC building main door from my mobile phone.

This is the Raspberry Pi server component that activates a relay switch to "press the buzzer" on my intercom. It takes signed HTTP requests to enact the switch.

There are [Android](https://github.com/skim1420/open-doors-android) and [iOS](https://github.com/skim1420/open-doors-ios) client apps, which are single-button app that send the signed HTTP request.
